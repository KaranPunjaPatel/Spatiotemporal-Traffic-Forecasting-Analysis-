HI Multi-Model Traffic Flow Prediction: STGCN vs RNN vs GAT\n\nThis notebook implements and compares three different deep learning approaches for traffic flow prediction on multiple datasets:\n\n1. **STGCN** - Spatio-Temporal Graph Convolutional Network\n2. **RNN** - Recurrent Neural Network (LSTM)  \n3. **GAT** - Graph Attention Network\n\nEach model captures different aspects of traffic patterns and we'll compare their performance comprehensively.\n\n## 📊 Supported Datasets\n\nThis notebook supports **three datasets** - switch between them using the `DATASET_NAME` variable in Step 2:\n\n1. **PEMS08**: California highway traffic sensors\n   - 170 sensors\n   - 5-minute intervals, ~17,000 timesteps\n   - Features: Flow, Occupancy, Speed (mph → km/h)\n\n2. **HZMetro**: Hangzhou Metro system\n   - Pre-split train/val/test data\n   - Multiple graph types (connectivity, correlation, similarity)\n   - Features from metro operations\n\n3. **SHMetro**: Shanghai Metro system\n   - Pre-split train/val/test data  \n   - Multiple graph types (connectivity, correlation, similarity)\n   - Features from metro operations\n\n## Task\n- **Input**: Past 12 timesteps (1 hour)\n- **Output**: Next 3 timesteps (15 minutes)  \n- **Features**: Multi-feature traffic/metro data (typically 3 features)\n\n## Model Comparison\n- **STGCN**: Combines Chebyshev graph convolution + 2D convolution\n- **RNN**: LSTM for temporal modeling (ignores spatial relationships)\n- **GAT**: Graph attention + 2D convolution for adaptive spatial modeling\n- **Input**: (batch_size, 170, 12, 3) - 170 sensors, 12 timesteps, 3 features\n- **Output**: (batch_size, 170, 3, 3) - 170 sensors, 3 future timesteps, 3 features\n\n---\n\n## 📋 **Notebook Structure Overview**\n\nThis notebook is organized into clear steps:\n\n1. **Step 1**: Environment Setup and Dependencies\n2. **Step 2**: Data Loading and Preprocessing  \n3. **Step 3**: Model Architecture Implementation\n4. **Step 4**: Multi-Model Training Framework\n5. **Step 5**: Comprehensive Model Evaluation and Comparison\n6. **Step 6**: Extensions and Future Improvements\n\nEach step builds upon the previous one, creating a complete pipeline for traffic flow prediction and model comparison.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# 🚀 Step 1: Environment Setup and Dependencies\n\nIn this step, we'll:\n- Install required packages for PyTorch, PyTorch Geometric, and other dependencies\n- Import necessary libraries for deep learning, data processing, and visualization\n- Set up the computing environment (CPU/GPU)\n- Configure random seeds for reproducibility\n\n## What we're installing:\n- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework\n- **PyTorch Geometric**: Graph neural network library\n- **Scikit-learn**: Data preprocessing and metrics\n- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Visualization libraries\n\n## Key Setup Details:\n- **Device**: Automatically detects and uses GPU if available\n- **Random Seeds**: Ensures

Metro (pre-split, uses `graph_hz_conn.pkl` by default)\n- `'SHMetro'` - Shanghai Metro (pre-split, uses `graph_sh_conn.pkl` by default)\n\n**For Metro datasets**, you can also change `graph_type`:\n- `'conn'` - Connectivity graph (default)\n- `'cor'` - Correlation graph\n- `'sml'` - Similarity graph\n\n## Data Processing Pipeline:\n1. **Load Data**: Automatic format detection (.npz for PEMS08, .pkl for Metro)\n2. **Convert Units**: Speed from mph to km/h (PEMS08 only)\n3. **Normalize**: Per-sensor, per-feature normalization\n4. **Create Sequences**: 12 timesteps → 3 timesteps prediction\n5. **Split Data**: 70% train, 15% validation, 15% test (PEMS08) or use pre-split (Metro)\n6. **Graph Format**: Convert to edge_index and edge_weight (PyG format)\n\n## Key Features:\n- **Unified Loader**: Handles multiple dataset formats automatically\n- **Robust Loading**: Handles nested .npz, pickle files, various graph formats\n- **Multi-feature**: Flow, occupancy, speed (3 features typically)\n- **Flexible Normalization**: Multiple strategies available\n- **Graph Structure**: Proper PyG format for GNNs\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"#
